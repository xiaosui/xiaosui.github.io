                 <p>My name is Xiao Sui. I am currently a second year master student major in Public Relations. I'm from Nanjing, China, and this is also the second year for me to stay here in the US.</p>
                 <p>I love rock music. My favriote bands varied from Nirvana, Oasis, My Chemical Romance, to Metallica. I also enjoy watching movies, and my favriote director is Quentin Tarantino.Though never a professional photographer, I love taking pictures.</p>
                 <p>I'm hoping to launch my career as a public relations practitioner or a marketing technician after graduate. Staying in the US would be my best choice as I still have so much more to learn about this country.</p>
