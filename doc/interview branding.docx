How would you describe the difference or relationship between branding and marketing?
--Marketing is much more comprehensive than branding. Marketing includes a lot of different activities like logistic, pricing, even packaging design. Branding is about identifying the position and message, and then convey the message. It is more conceptual and more focus than marketing. 

Will you considering them as overlapped?
--Of course, branding is a part of marketing.


Which type of skill is more important in branding – communicating or designing? 
--The old style of thinking about branding is more about visual communication. Now branding is almost like a philosophy. Marketing communication is one concept of branding. There is much more strategic communication than just visual design.

Shall we say the communication skill is becoming more important in recent years?
--It has always been important. It’s just becoming more complex. Because there is many more ways of communicating, and you have to be much more thoughtful to be successful. 

Do you think the educational institutions should put more emphasis on developing writing skills/presenting skills or technical skills?
--I think you should learn everything if you have the choice, and you need to be curious. But in terms of priority, I wouldn’t suggest spending most of your time coding, because the world is evolving in a way that is so fast. Also, there are other people who are specialized in coding and you can just use the templates for it. I would learn everything so that I know what people are doing, but we do need to prioritize. 


Which type of thinking is more important in branding – analytical or creative thinking? Why?
--I would say 50 to 50 percent. If you are not creative, you are not going to attract people’s attention. The realm of brands is so noisy that only creativity will break through the noise. The analytical can give creative the right foundation to get started. If you are good at marketing research, you can set parameter for creative people, so that they can be more creative. Without the parameter of thinking, they don’t know how to be creative. The analytical people can tell the creative people what the message is about.


Do you believe digital media will replace traditional media in terms of marketing and branding?
--No, it will not completely replace traditional media. It will become more hybrid. It is like one plus one equals three. People are given more options, more combinations. People still like to grab something tangible. The number is becoming smaller but it will not disappear. I’ve done a lot of research that people don’t want them to disappear. 


How would you predict the branding trends in the near future?
--I cannot predict the trend because the world is changing. But I think the engagement is important. However, you need to keep a good balance between engagement and bothering privacy. People want to be engaged but they don’t want to be bothered.
